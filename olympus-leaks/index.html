                <p>Team,</p>
                <p>I am pleased to announce the strategic merger (wedding) of our valued consultant <strong>Thetis</strong> (Nereid Branch) and regional contractor <strong>Peleus</strong> (Myrmidon Branch).</p>
                <p>As many of you know, our internal Risk Assessment Team identified a critical compliance issue regarding Thetis’s future projects (specifically, <em>Prophecy Code 7.7: "Son > Father"</em>). To mitigate this risk and ensure the stability of the current Board of Directors, we have decided she will merge with a <strong>Mortal Partner</strong> rather than Executive Leadership.</p>

                • Location: Mount Pelion Banquet Hall<br>

                <p>Effective immediately, we are initiating a hostile restructuring of the city of Troy. Due to the recent arbitration decision by your representative (Paris), the Olympian Board has voted to dissolve the Trojan asset.</p>

                    <li><strong>Aphrodite</strong> is placed on probation for facilitating the abduction of the Helen asset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paris</strong> is flagged for gross violations of <em>Xenia</em>. He is to be terminated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> Unlimited support for Greek contractors (Achilles, Odysseus, Agamemnon).</li>
                    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Prepare for a 10-Year fiscal siege.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="report-body">
                <p><strong>Myth Reworked</strong><br>
                For my reception project, I reworked the myth of the <strong>Judgment of Paris</strong> and the <strong>Wedding of Peleus and Thetis</strong> (Lecture 7) through the lens of modern corporate bureaucracy. Using the format of leaked emails, chat logs, and HR incident reports, I satirized the transactional and petty nature of the Olympian gods. This format highlights how the Trojan War—a cataclysmic event—began not with a grand battle, but with a series of administrative failures, social snubs, and bribes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Use of Course Concepts</strong><br>
                The toggleable "Hermes Annotations" explicitly connect the creative choices to course material.
                <br>• The <strong>Email</strong> references Zeus’s "succession anxiety" regarding Thetis’s prophecy (that her son would be stronger than his father), which is why she was married off to a mortal (Lecture 7).
                <br>• The <strong>HR Report</strong> identifies Paris's choice not just as a preference, but as a violation of <strong>Xenia</strong> (Guest-Host friendship), noting that accepting Helen required him to violate the hospitality of Menelaus.
                <br>• The <strong>Bribe Table</strong> translates the goddesses' offers into corporate assets: Power (Hera), Kleos/Glory (Athena), and Physical Beauty (Aphrodite).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Creative Decisions</strong><br>
                I chose the corporate format because it serves as a modern metaphor for the <strong>Aristocratic</strong> nature of the gods discussed throughout the course (Lecture 4). The gods often act like a dysfunctional family business, concerned with hierarchy and reputation rather than morality. The "Redacted" text feature emphasizes the theme of forbidden knowledge, while the interactive "Hermes Mode" allows me to embed my academic analysis directly into the creative experience.</p>

            <div class="creator-note">
                <h3>/// CREATOR'S NOTE: THE SOURCE CODE OF MYTH ///</h3>
                <p>As a Computer Science student with a passion for web development, I approached this project by seeking the intersection between ancient narrative systems and modern digital systems. Mythology often functions remarkably like legacy code: it operates on strict logic (Fate/Prophecy), has rigid hierarchies (Olympus/Database Permissions), and contains fatal "bugs" (Tragedy/Hubris) that crash the system.</p>
                <p>I chose to build this as an interactive "leaked database" because the medium is the message. By forcing the user to "hack" into the files and interact with elements like the "Hermes Annotations," I am simulating the work of a Classicist—digging through fragmented evidence to reconstruct meaning. This project allowed me to merge my technical skills with the course content, demonstrating that while the technology changes, the underlying stories of power and conflict remain constant.</p>
