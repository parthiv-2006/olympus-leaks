# OLYMPUS LEAKS | The Troy Files

A digital reception project for **CLA204 Classical Mythology** (Fall 2025).

## 🏛️ Project Overview
This project re-imagines the myth of the **Judgment of Paris** and the **Wedding of Peleus and Thetis** through the lens of modern corporate espionage. The site functions as a "leaked database" containing emails, chat logs, and HR forms that detail the administrative failures of the Olympian Gods leading up to the Trojan War.

## 🚀 Features
- **Password Gate:** Simulates a secure server breach (Password: `TROY`).
- **Interactive Documents:** Leaked files styled as Outlook emails, Slack logs, and official memos.
- **Hermes Mode:** A toggle switch that reveals hidden academic annotations, connecting the satire back to course concepts (Xenia, Hubris, Kleos).
- **Dynamic Background:** A JavaScript-generated constellation network.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS Variables, Keyframe Animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (Canvas API, Intersection Observers)

## 🎓 Creator's Note
As a Computer Science student, I wanted to explore the parallels between the rigid, logic-based systems of code and the rigid, prophecy-based systems of Greek Myth. Both systems are prone to fatal errors when "users" (heroes) attempt to bypass the rules.
